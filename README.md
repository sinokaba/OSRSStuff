Automated aid to help advance your oldschool runescape character financially and skill wise.

## Getting Started
Currently only have one script available, the Pro chickenz, the best chicken slayer around. Keeps track of profits/hr, xp/hr, and has several features such as random misslicks, idleness, camera rotation, looking at different tabs to throw the developer's bot detecting program off. It works I tell ya, I haven't been banned for over 3 hours.

### Prerequisites

* Tri bot VIP
* JAVA IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ

### Installing

* Download java file of desired script
* Create a new Java Project using your IDE and add the .java file downloaded.
* Insert the path to the tribot.jar file to the newly created Java Project as an external jar.
* Compile the .java file downloaded using the java IDE of your choice
* Go to workspace, or wherever your IDE stores your java projects, then click on the folder where you inserted the downloaded java file into
* Go to bin and copy all the java class files
* Launch tri bot and go to File -> View Local Scripts Folder -> paste copied java classes
* You can now run the script as you would any other script you have installed.
